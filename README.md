# TicTacToe Multiplayer
Same application as [TicTacToe](https://github.com/JustD4nTe/TicTacToe) but it has been extended to include a network connection(localhost).

## Setup
It's already configured for Visual Studio 2017 (v141 toolset).\
At first you must run a server program, then u can execute only two clients.\
It works only in localhost.
